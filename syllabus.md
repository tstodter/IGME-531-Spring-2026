## IV. Course Materials and Communication

### Required Texts

There are no required text purchases for this course. Readings will be provided through MyCourses and lecture notes.

### Communication

I will be using Discord primarily, but also email and MyCourses, to communicate reminders, updates to assignments, and so on. Please check Discord and your email regularly to make sure you have the most up to date information. You are welcome to communicate anything to me regarding the course via email or Discord. I will endeavor to respond to emails and messages within 24 hours.

**If you need to discuss grades or personal matters, I ask that you do it through my RIT email address**. Legally, since Discord is not FERPA compliant, I cannot discuss those sorts of things there.

## VI. Course Organization

### Readings / Videos

Readings, videos, and other supplementary materials will be prescribed throughout the semester. These might include excerpts from academic texts, academic papers, recorded conference talks, blog posts, or any other material I think is interesting and worth your time. It's best to think of this as a curated collection of material; you could find it on your own, but I'm saving you the work of sifting through the entire internet for the good bits. It's important that you take the time to watch and read these. I may ask you to submit some artifact attesting to your having done so. If you're struggling to keep up with them, don't hesitate to ask for help. I may recommend which prescribed content is most important, or help you skim through the content to the most important bits.

### Reflections

Weekly reflections are lightweight, freeform opportunities for you to think just a bit further on the class's topics. They will be required every week, and function as the class's heartbeat: they let me know you're still invested, if you're struggling to keep up, where you are in understanding the material. They are not intended to stress you out or require a great deal of effort, and only require that you take a moment every week to think creatively and critically on what you've learned.

### Assignments

Assignments are activities and exercises designed to explore and reinforce concepts and techniques discussed in class. They are a way to gain experience with the materials to help "lock in the learning". If you are having trouble with an assignment, they also help to reveal things to work on. In general, assignments will be due within one to three classes after when they are assigned.

### Projects

Projects are larger exercises designed to "put it all together" and draw upon multiple concepts and techniques. The projects will give you experience in writing your own functional code, going beyond copying and moving further towards synthesis.

There will (tentatively) be 4 projects, one for each unit of the course and one to cap everything off.

#### Critique
The ability to give critique in a constructive way and to accept critique is core to most artistic education. It is also tremendously valuable in all things, not just art. As such, we will actively engage in critique throughout the semester in various forms for things such as assignments and projects. As a result, your attendance in class is required and essential so that you can participate in these sorts of discussions and activities.

## VII. Grading & Assessment

In general, grading procedure for the course follows [University Policy D05.0](https://www.rit.edu/academicaffairs/policiesmanual/d050), which describes policies regarding points awarded for grade, handling of withdrawals (D05.0, Section IV), and so on.

### Course Element Weights

| Course Element | Weight |
| :------------- | :----- |
| In-class activities, Attendance | 20% |
| Reflections | 10% |
| Assignments | 30% |
| Projects | 40% |

### Letter Grade Thresholds

| Grade Range | Letter Grade |
| :---------- | :----------- |
| >= 90 | A |
| >= 80 | B |
| >= 70 | C |
| >= 60 | D |
| < 60 | F |

### Evaluation Criteria

I will do my best to provide feedback for all submitted work within two weeks of the submission deadline (per University policy) and will post all grades to MyCourses. However, depending upon circumstance, feedback may be provided more than two weeks after the submission deadline.

In addition to the grade for projects, assignments and exams, I will add any additional notes and feedback to the grade in MyCourses.

If you have any questions about a grade, you are welcome to discuss with me further via email or in-person by scheduling a meeting.

## VIII. Attendance

Attendance is not strictly mandatory, but infrequent attendance will significantly impact your grade. There will be in-class activities that cannot generally be made up if you miss class, and these will often happen without previous warning.

It never hurts to let me know your plans ahead of time. If you've not typically missed class, I will wonder where you are. Generally, the more information you can give me the better I can help you and assist you in your learning. If you are dealing with a stressful situation and need a bit of slack, talk to me and we can work it out. If you wish to attend interesting events of professional interest, contact me to discuss possibilities for extensions on work deadlines.

In any case, if you miss class or cannot fulfill participation requirements, you are responsible for checking with classmates for notes and MyCourses for posted materials.

If I need to miss class, I will let you know as soon as possible both through email and Discord. The department will also post a sign on the classroom door letting you know.

## IX. More Grading Policies

### IX-A. Late Assignments

Assignments are due at the announced date and time (usually the due date posted with the assignment drop box on MyCourses). There is no grade deduction for submitting work late, but late submissions may not be accepted once we start grading the assignment in question. *We may begin grading at any point after the due date.*

Most assignments are critiqued in-class, and we will usually grade them during the critique. *Therefore, most assignments may not be accepted after the critique.*

If you foresee a scheduling conflict with a posted assignment, contact me as soon as possible to work out an alternative submission plan.

*As a final caveat to the above*, I'm not interested in being a hard-ass about this. If things aren't going your way or extenuating circumstances begin to extenuate, talk to me and we can usually work something out.

### IX-B. Academic Integrity

As part of the RIT academic community, it is imperative that you maintain the highest standards of academic honesty in this course. This policy outlines our commitment to uphold academic integrity and the consequences of violating it.

- Cheating: Engaging in any form of fraudulent or deceptive academic act, including falsification of data and unauthorized possession or use of materials, sources, or tools. See also our Generative AI policy (next section).
- Collusion: Inappropriate collaboration with others in work that is meant to be completed individually.
- Plagiarism: Representing the ideas of others as your own without proper attribution.
- Duplicate Submission: Submitting work in this course that you have previously submitted in this course or another, without prior approval. Importantly, if you have previously taken this course and are retaking it (whether due to a withdrawal or to improve a grade), all submitted work must be original and created anew for this semester. Resubmitting past work, even your own, without explicit permission is not allowed and will be treated as a breach of academic integrity.

Consequences: Breaches of academic integrity, including but not limited to cheating, collusion, plagiarism, and duplicate submission, will result in serious disciplinary action. This may range from failing the assignment to potentially failing the course, depending on the violation's severity. Each case will be carefully reviewed in accordance with the RIT Academic Integrity Policy.

For full details on the policy and your responsibilities within it, please visit [RIT's Academic Integrity website](https://www.rit.edu/academicintegrity/).

### IX-C. Generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT)

AI tools like ChatGPT, Github Copilot, Midjourney, and others can be both a help and a hindrance. They can act as a force multiplier, boosting your efficiency, effectiveness, and creativity. However, relying on them too much may impact your learning of essential concepts. Additionally, some employers may not permit their intellectual property to be fed into these systems, and so disallow their usage.

In this class:
- You should use generative AI if I explicitly ask you to do so; you should *not* use generative AI if I explicitly forbid you from doing so.
- You should use generative AI if it enhances your work, but does not replace your understanding.
- Use generative AI to quickly become effective with new tools and technology, but remain vigilant that you do not become dependent on them. Tools exist to expand your agency, and should be abandoned when they become limitations.
- Any time that you do use these tools, you must clearly document what came from
the tool and what came from you. This must be clearly stated in your submission
or discussion post (wherever relevant). You can also leave comments in your
code to make it clear

You are responsible for understanding the course content on your own, and demonstrating this understanding, without machine assistance.

## XIII. Student Support & Wellbeing

Success in this course depends heavily on your personal health and wellbeing. Recognize that stress is an expected part of the college experience, and it often can be compounded by unexpected setbacks or life changes outside the classroom. Moreover, those with marginalized identities may be faced with additional social stressors. I strongly encourage you to reframe challenges as an unavoidable pathway to success. Reflect on your role in taking care of yourself throughout the term, before the demands of exams and projects reach their peak. Please feel free to reach out to me about any difficulty you may be having that may impact your performance in this course as soon as it occurs and before it becomes unmanageable. In addition to your academic advisor, I strongly encourage you to contact the many other support services on campus that stand ready to assist you.
